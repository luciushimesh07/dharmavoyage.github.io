<!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<div class="section-box">
    <h2>About Socrates</h2>
    <p>
        Socrates is considered the founding pillar of Western philosophy. He left behind 
        no written works — instead, his wisdom survives through the accounts of his 
        students, especially Plato. His method was dialogue: questioning assumptions, 
        exposing contradictions, and leading others toward truth through introspection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Socrates believed that real wisdom is knowing one’s own ignorance, that virtue 
        is the highest good, and that truth should be pursued even at the cost of one’s 
        life — a principle he demonstrated by accepting his death sentence with calm 
        dignity.
